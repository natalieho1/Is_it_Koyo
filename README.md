# Is it Koyo? 
My first ML project working on an image classification model to identify if an image contains my friends Mitchell or Koyo! 

Highlights 

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
- Used fastai and pillow libraries
- Learned how to upload a dataset to Kaggle 

## ðŸŒŸ Challenges 
- Ran into an UnidentifiedImageError multiple times. I realized that I had to convert some images from HEIC into JPG. But even that wasn't enough! I had to compress all the images to avoid this error.
- At first I had uploaded two separate folders of images. I realized I had to put the two Koyo and Mitchell subfolders into one larger Images folder as a complete dataset, so that DataBlock could be called and sort images of different categories.

## ðŸŒŸ Reflections 
I should have used pictures of just Mitchell and Koyo individually, this probably would have made my results more accurate.
